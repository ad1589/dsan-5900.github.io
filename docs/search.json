by state. Some findings from the maps are:\n\nFlorida had the highest rate of admitted students.\nUtah had the lowest rate of admitted students.\nFlorida also has the highest rate of rejected students.\nCalifornia, Oregon, and Mississippi all have the lowest rate of rejected students.\n\nThere isnâ€™t a clear relationship between admissions and rejections by state, which means that the state a student is from is not pivotal in the decision of their internship application.\n\n\n\nGender\nIt is important to establish that internship opportunities are given fairly and equitably to all students regardless of gender. Analyzing decisions by gender can highlight any discrepancies or biases in the selection process, which is the primary focus of the following section.\n\n\nCode\n%%html\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"../website/images/heatmap.png\"  style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: Heatmap of student internship decisions by gender to highlight any biases that may appear.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n    \n    Figure 1: Heatmap of student internship decisions by gender to highlight any biases that may appear.\n\n\n\nThe heatmap above display internship decision counts among females and males. Because the colors represent counts in very similar ranges, it appears gender is not a contribuing factor to internship decisions. However, itâ€™s important to back that statement with statistics, such as a Chi-Square test. Due to the relatively small size of the data set, a chi-square test may not always be accurate. An exact test was also performed, Fisherâ€™s Exact Test, to verify the result from the Chi-Square test.\n\n\nCode\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\n\ncont_table = pd.crosstab(df[\"Gender\"], df[\"Decision\"])\nchi2_stat, p_value_chi2, _, _ = chi2_contingency(cont_table)\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistic - Chi-Square Test\nValue\n\n\n\n\nChi-Square Statistic\n0.0234\n\n\nChi-Square P-value\n0.9883\n\n\n\nThe Chi-Square statistic measures the difference between gender frequencies in each decision category within the data and gender frequencies in each decision that would be expected if there was no association between the variables. A lower chi-square value as seen above, indicates that the observed frequencies are very close to the expected frequencies. The large P-value (greater than 0.05) confirms that there is no significant association between gender and admission decisions, indicating no evidence of bias based on this test; a desired result.\n\n\nCode\nfrom scipy.stats import fisher_exact\ncont_table_small = cont_table[[\"Admit\", \"Decline\"]]\nodds_ratio, p_value_fish = fisher_exact(cont_table_small)\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistic - Fisherâ€™s Exact Test\nValue\n\n\n\n\nFisherâ€™s Odds Ratio\n1.0833\n\n\nFisherâ€™s Test P-Value\n1.0\n\n\n\nFor Fisherâ€™s Exact Test, the odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of an event occurring in one group compared to another. There is a positive association if the odds ratio is greater than 1. The odds ratio of 1.083 means that the odds of being admitted for one group are 8.3% higher than the odds of the other group being admitted. While Fisherâ€™s Exact found a difference, the p-value for the test is equal to 1, which is higher than above any given significance level. This verifies the results of the Chi-Square test, indicating no evidence of bias between admisisons and gender."

    "text": "Machine Learning\nBefore applying machine learning, below we will explain the reasoning behind applying ML to the student admissions data. We wanted to identify relationships between the academic features in the data on the decision, namely GPA, writing score, and test score. The motivation behind this is to use the information of the relationships, if any are present, to help students in our university understand what features of their application might contribute to the decision. We then hope to provide targeted help to our students based on our findings to increase the number of students admitted to internships.\n\n\nCode\n%%html\n<img src=\"../website/images/decision_pairplot.png\">\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove is the pairplot of GPA, writing score, and test score of the students grouped by the decision. When looking at the scatterplots, we notice some patterns:\n\nStudents with low test score, no matter the GPA, were declined.\nStudents with high test score and high GPA were accepted.\nStudents with a pretty high GPA but average test score were waitlisted.\nStudents with high test score, no matter the writing score, were admitted.\nStudents with a low test score, no matter the writing score, were declined.\nStudents with high writing scores but average test score were waitlisted.\n\nThrough the pairplot we can see that some of the academic features have relationships by decision result, but some features seem to be more important than others. We will investigate the importance of all features on decision using XGBoost and Shapley values.\n\nXGBoost and Shapley\nTo understand the factors that may have played a role in determining college student internship decisions, a tree-based machine learning model, XGBoost, was trained and tested. By analyzing the results of the model using statistical game theory elements called Shapley values, we can also detetermine how strongly each factor influenced internship decisions. Understanding such relationships will highlight opportunities for improvement in the college curriculum to ensure all of the students have the highest probability of being accepted for a summer internship.\n\n\nCode\n%%html\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"../website/images/shap.png\"  style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: Visualization of SHAP values indicating the overall impact of various features on internship decisions.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n    \n    Figure 1: Visualization of SHAP values indicating the overall impact of various features on internship decisions.\n\n\n\nThe figure above quantifies studentâ€™s academic and wholistic attributes influence on internship application outcomes overall. Higher SHAP values mean those features have a greater impact internship decisions. Conversely, lower SHAP values indicate factors that are less important in the internship decision making process.\nAs we can see, test scores, GPA, and writing scores are among the top contributors while features such as work experience and volunteer level are not weighed as heaviliy. This highlights that companies are looking to the studentâ€™s academic background as a main focus for their decision compared to their wholistic attributes.\n\n\nCode\n%%html\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"../website/images/spec_shap.png\"  style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 2: Visualization of SHAP values indicating the impact of various features on internship application outcomes by decision.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n    \n    Figure 2: Visualization of SHAP values indicating the impact of various features on internship application outcomes by decision.\n\n\n\nWhile the previous plot displayed how student attributes play a role in the internship decision making process overall, Shapley statistics allow further steps to be taken by analyzing how each feature contributes to each possible deicion (Admit, Waitlist, Decline).\nThe figure above displays just that. It appears that the test score is the most significant factor contributing to a studentâ€™s likelihood of being admitted. It falls in line with the earlier pairplot as we saw significant overlap in internship decisions among GPAs and writing scores, but distinct separation for test scores. This suggests that students with higher test scores have a greater advantage in the competitive internship landscape.\nFor students who are placed on a waitlist, both test scores and GPA are important considerations. This might indicate that students on the waitlist have comparatively lower test scores than those who are admitted outright. The pairplot displays exactly that so it seems that for these students, academic performance is a deciding factor that could tip the balance in their favor for internship admission.\nOn the other hand, for students who are declined, the test score still holds considerable weight, but the writing score becomes notably more influential. This pattern could imply that declined students, while possibly having adequate test scores, may fall short in demonstrating the necessary writing proficiency, which is critical for many internships that require strong communication skills."

We wanted to identify relationships between the academic features in the data on the decision, namely GPA, writing score, and test score. The motivation behind this is to use the information of the relationships, if any are present, to help students in our university understand what features of their application might contribute to the decision. We then hope to provide targeted help to our students based on our findings to increase the number of students admitted to internships.\n\n\nCode\n%%html\n<img src=\"../website/images/decision_pairplot.png\">\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove is the pairplot of GPA, writing score, and test score of the students grouped by the decision. When looking at the scatterplots, we notice some patterns:\n\nStudents with low test score, no matter the GPA, were declined.\nStudents with high test score and high GPA were accepted.\nStudents with a pretty high GPA but average test score were waitlisted.\nStudents with high test score, no matter the writing score, were admitted.\nStudents with a low test score, no matter the writing score, were declined.\nStudents with high writing scores but average test score were waitlisted.\n\nThrough the pairplot we can see that some of the academic features have relationships by decision result, but some features seem to be more important than others. We will investigate the importance of all features on decision using XGBoost and Shapley values.\n\nXGBoost and Shapley\nTo understand the factors that may have played a role in determining college student internship decisions, a tree-based machine learning model, XGBoost, was trained and tested. By analyzing the results of the model using statistical game theory elements called Shapley values, we can also detetermine how strongly each factor influenced internship decisions. Understanding such relationships will highlight opportunities for improvement in the college curriculum to ensure all of the students have the highest probability of being accepted for a summer internship.\n\n\nCode\n%%html\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"../website/images/shap.png\"  style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <figcaption style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1: Visualization of SHAP values indicating the overall impact of various features on internship decisions.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n    \n    Figure 1: Visualization of SHAP values indicating the overall impact of various features on internship decisions.\n\n\n\nThe figure above quantifies studentâ€™s academic and wholistic attributes influence on internship application outcomes overall.
